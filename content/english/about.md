My name is Khareem Leslie, and I am a current Master of Economics Student at Georgia State University located in Atlanta, GA. I am a current Graduate Research Assistant with the Fiscal Research Center. My current interest are in Education Financing and Public Policy. 

In Summer 2022, I plan on doing with an internship with Equifax in the Data and Analytics Team. 

Outside of school and work I enjoy: 
- Playing Computer Games
- Photography/Videography
- Sleeping
